        <h3>Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Sophie Rosenberg, I am a
          coding student with
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank" title="shecodes.io"
            >SheCodes</a
          >, based in London in the UK. The best way to learn is by doing, and I
          made this website to showcase some of the projects that I have been
          working on over the course of my journey into learning to code. My
          biggest project so far is this website itself! üòä

            I completed this project at the end of the SheCodes Plus course.
            This project is much more advanced than anything I had tried before.
            Not only does this feature HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Bootstrap, but
            it involves connecting my application with real world weather data
            using an API. This application has a functioning search form and
            geolocation option, and will return the result for the location
            searched or the user's location including a five day forecast.
            Learning how to make this application required that I learn so many
            new concepts and I was very pleased with the end result. </br>
            Since the end of the course, I have developed this project further by adding an hourly forecast.

            This was my first project which I completed at the end of the three
            week SheCodes Basics course. The project consists of a single file
            which utilises some CSS styling and a JavaScript function
            incorporating If statements. I had a lot of fun on this first
            project, and when I started the course I had no idea that I would be
            able to learn how make a project like this so soon after starting to
            learn to code.
